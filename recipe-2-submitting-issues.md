# ðŸ¤– Recipe 2: Submitting issues

One of the most common ways to contribute to the openEuler community is to submit issues. An issue refers to a task to be completed. Such task can be a "problem", "requirement", or "suggestion". Issues are done through Gitee platform, which is like GitHub. You can view all openEuler project repositories at [Gitee](https://gitee.com/openeuler). If you are more comfortable with GitHub than Gitee, don't worry, we have you covered. openEuler has a mirror on [GitHub](https://github.com/openeuler-mirror), where also contains all the repositories. Submitting issues is a great way to improve openEuler, solve problems, and share your ideas. You can also get feedback and suggestions from other developers, and learn from their experience and expertise. So, don't be shy, submit your issues and let your voice be heard! And don't worry, we won't bite, unless you submit something really bad. Just kidding, we are nice and friendly, we promise.
