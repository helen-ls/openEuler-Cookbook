You think this is goodbye? Well, the mission doesn't end here. What's a cookbook without the continuous addition of new recipes over time?

openEuler is all about the spirit of open source - collaboration and sharing. Did you tweak a recipe to perfection? Come up with an original creation using openEuler? We'd love for you to submit your innovative recipes so we can share them with the community in upcoming cookbook volumes.

Let's keep cooking together to create a rich knowledge base for using openEuler!
