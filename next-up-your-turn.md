# ðŸ’ž Next up, your turn!

You think this is goodbye? Well, the mission doesn't end here. What's a cookbook without the continuous addition of new recipes over time?

openEuler is all about the spirit of open source â€“ collaboration and sharing. Did you tweak a recipe to perfection? Come up with an original creation using openEuler? We'd love for you to submit your innovative recipes so we can share them with the community in upcoming cookbook volumes.

If you wanna learn more about what openEuler can do, check out this video showing off some of its cool capabilities. And if you have your own openEuler tricks up your sleeve, share them with the community! We're always looking to get more cooks in the kitchen. So come on and join the openEuler crew, code alongside devs from around the world, and help build up this open source ecosystem!
