# ðŸŽ® Recipe 5: Developing new software

If you're feeling adventurous, it's time to unleash your creativity and develop a brand-new software for openEuler. Whether it's a useful tool, an exciting application, or a groundbreaking library, this recipe will guide you through the process of building and contributing your software to the openEuler distributions. Get ready to leave your mark on the openEuler universe!

* Developing outside the openEuler community: If you already have your own project on GitHub, GitLab, or Gitee, then you only need to add the software to the [src-openEuler](https://gitee.com/src-openeuler) repository.
* Developing in the openEuler community: Another method is to directly create a project in [https://gitee.com/openeuler](https://gitee.com/openeuler), and host your project to the openEuler community. If you have a great idea that you want to turn into a reality in the openEuler community, just follow the steps below:

1. Pitch your ideas to the Technical Committee on its regular meetings.
2. Once proved by the Technical Committee, set up your repository at [https://gitee.com/openeuler](https://gitee.com/openeuler) or [https://github.com/openeuler-mirror](https://github.com/openeuler-mirror).
3. Develop and incubate your project in openEuler until it matures.
4. Create a repository in [src-openeuler](https://gitee.com/src-openeuler) and provide an RPM file.
5. Celebrate your success! You have successfully completed your open source project in the openEuler community, and become a part of openEuler distros.

Developing new software is not only a way to innovate openEuler, create something unique and original, and express your vision and passion. It is also a way to challenge yourself, learn new things, and have fun.
