# ðŸ¥° Recipe 1: Joining a SIG

The spice that gives openEuler its flavor is the community. The openEuler community is organized based on special interest groups (SIGs) to better manage and improve the work processes. Each SIG focuses on one or more specific areas or functions, such as kernel, security, container, database, etc. Registering with a SIG enables you to submit, discuss, and resolve issues with other members, as well as participate in reviews in a SIG repository. You can choose to join one or more SIGs according to your interests and expertise, and collaborate and communicate with like-minded developers. Check out the [SIG list](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-list) to find one that matches your tastes. Or start a new SIG following the [hands-on instructions](https://www.openeuler.org/en/sig/sig-guidance).
