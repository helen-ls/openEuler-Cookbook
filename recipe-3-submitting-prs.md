# ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Recipe 3: Submitting PRs

Better than just reporting bugs, offer fixes by submitting patches! If you have fixed a bug, added a feature, or improved a document in openEuler, you can submit a pull request (PR) to the community. A PR is a way of proposing a change, updating a code, or modifying a document. Submitting PRs can really help us smooth out the lumps in our community cake.
